She\u2019s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who\u2019s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation. https://t.co/JSkUnRtaoD Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran\u2014not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We\u2019re forever in your debt. This Veterans Day, here\u2019s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I\u2019ve come to know over the years. It\u2019s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country https://t.co/rBAMNk0zvb No one says it better than @MichelleObama \u2014 the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/aHHeNvAisn Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country\u2014one that\u2019ll leave a lasting legacy. Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s election\u2014candidates who\u2019ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That\u2019s good policy\u2014and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm Today\u2019s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help\u2014so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today. Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together.

Tune in now at https://t.co/aGSLPSV4Fe for hi\u2026 RT @ObamaFoundation: Take a tour with @BarackObama through the future Obama Presidential Center on Chicago\u2019s South Side. https://t.co/n5n6s\u2026 Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It\u2019s where I first learned to organize\u2014and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we\u2019ll be exploring the meaning behind them\u2014tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm .@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world. Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it\u2019s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can\u2019t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women\u2019s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they\u2019re also remarkable examples of humanity\u2019s ability to endure\u2014and keep raising the bar. RT @MichelleObama: Happy #DayoftheGirl! I\u2019m excited to share that in December, I\u2019ll be visiting Vietnam to meet some of the inspiring girls\u2026 Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren\u2019t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC. Here\u2019s an interesting read\u2014a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we\u2019ll agree and sometimes we won\u2019t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn\u2019t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice\u2019s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you\u2019ll see why. It\u2019s a tribute to American leadership\u2014and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you\u2019ll read it. https://t.co/7iUWt76xUw Like the Beatles said: It\u2019s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! https://t.co/mImRqIYn1R On National Voter Registration Day, it\u2019s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX \u2014 and tell your friends, too. One challenge will define the future for today\u2019s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who\u2019ve organized and joined today\u2019s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it. Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C That\u2019s what Americans do when others are in need \u2013 we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnRcAfNIk2 Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he\u2019d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees.\nhttps://t.co/H6xBIW4Ka0 Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hXu68RPH As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I\u2019m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9PVcwDl Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit\u2014an example that progress can be slow, but it\u2019s always possible. We\u2019ll miss her, but we\u2019re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs Yesterday\u2019s ruling is a big win for North Carolina\u2014and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaIt Saw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it\u2014keep it up, David! That\u2019s some creative organizing.\nhttps://t.co/bbkbf7vygr Training is at the heart of organizing. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always made it a priority \u2013 from my 2008 campaign until now. And it\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce @allontheline\u2019s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U.

Hope you enjoy. https://t.co/BS5ri1lvxz A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else\u2019s life. It can help you find common ground. And it\u2019s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground\u2019s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix. https://t.co/KzkYFqjrFV Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/JG7Jgu4p9t Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: https://t.co/reTnmcg3xo https://t.co/nNOVtQ50O4 The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. https://t.co/dqnvNk9cQR Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline\u2019s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today: https://t.co/d9zwitUNOa https://t.co/mEbwKCDUiP Here\u2019s a worthwhile Sunday read: \u201c\u2026nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.\u201d https://t.co/tpdMZ9hJoE I\u2019ve always been proud of what this team accomplished during my administration.

Inequality, like many problems we face, is as vast as it is complex. But this article left me a little more hopeful: https://t.co/CcsXpVVfkP Here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: A new study on the Medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the Affordable Care Act\u2014and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms: https://t.co/Lj4g7lGFnq In America, we don\u2019t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it\u2019s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She\u2019s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtG RT @MichelleObama: What truly makes our country great is its diversity.

On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: https://t.co/kSkLHbfnc3 This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn\u2019t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96B7fkBM4u Yes we can, Greta. I\u2019m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. https://t.co/sUBwC0uNW8 Happy Father\u2019s Day to Charles, one of our @ObamaFoundation Fellows, and all the dads at Fathers\u2019 Uplift.

It's up to us to not simply reflect on their sacrifice but to honor it with service of our own\u2014and by living out the values they fought for. https://t.co/tZx3qcHnfV Great to get out there and take a few cuts at the plate yesterday\u2014I had a blast with all these extraordinary young people. Thanks for letting me drop in and thanks to the Nationals Youth Academy for the outstanding work you do to support youth in DC. https://t.co/GKRMd8kZxm RT @ObamaFoundation: Congratulations on the inauguration of @ChicagosMayor Lori Lightfoot, Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin, @ChiCityClerk\u2026 Here\u2019s a great story: While we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do to make college affordable for everyone, that didn\u2019t stop Robert F. Smith from seizing an opportunity to make a difference. He\u2019s erasing the student loan debt for this year\u2019s @Morehouse grads. https://t.co/I3X38Pbpjz Happy Mother's Day to the most caring, brilliant, funny, and grounded woman I know\u2014a perfect role model not just for our daughters, but so many others. Love you, @MichelleObama. https://t.co/liWmYaEPVk As part of the @ObamaFoundation, moms like Dr. Mwansa Ketty Lubeya are answering the call for change\u2014and raising the next generation of leaders while they\u2019re at it. https://t.co/llToyKG2Y7 RT @MichelleObama: Congratulations, Meghan and Harry! Barack and I are so thrilled for both of you and can't wait to meet him. #RoyalBaby h\u2026 Happy #CollegeSigningDay, everybody! I'm proud of every student out there who's taking the next step in their education. It's the best thing you can do for yourself and your future. https://t.co/SZQaUG2Zze Condolences to the family of John Singleton. His seminal work, Boyz n the Hood, remains one of the most searing, loving portrayals of the challenges facing inner-city youth. He opened doors for filmmakers of color to tell powerful stories that have been too often ignored. Congratulations to the new class of @ObamaFoundation Fellows! Their work in every region of the globe is already making the world better, and I hope this experience helps them make an even bigger impact. https://t.co/azK2Y9Iw5c https://t.co/tuKO1SFhSK For thirty-six years, Richard Lugar proved that pragmatism and decency work\u2014not only in Washington but all over the world. Michelle and I send our warmest sympathies to his family and all those who had the privilege of knowing this American statesman. https://t.co/Oy5DzPwkGb Dominique\u2019s story is a reminder to us that where you\u2019re from shouldn\u2019t define what you can achieve. I\u2019m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. https://t.co/eD95oWrOk4 This generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world. So while this challenge is only getting more urgent, they show us the kind of action it'll take to meet this moment. And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEI I met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month. Luisa, the organizer behind the student movement in Germany, says, \u201cIt\u2019s our future and we\u2019re not going to stop fighting for it.\u201d https://t.co/hS03PCWYAq They're people like 16-year-old @GretaThunberg, whose protests at Swedish parliament sparked a movement. Inspired by Greta's action, Fridays for Future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate. https://t.co/un7nBhEF8i Young people all over the world are leading the way in the fight to protect our planet because they know their future depends on it. This Earth Day, I want to celebrate the courageous, committed young leaders who are stepping up to save the one planet we've got. To all who celebrate today, happy Easter from our family to yours! On this day of rebirth and renewal, let\u2019s recommit to love and serve our brothers and sisters, especially those in need, in every way we can. Have a great day, everybody. https://t.co/BtMyWebGLw The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka. Notre Dame is one of the world\u2019s great treasures, and we\u2019re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It\u2019s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost \u2013 but it\u2019s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. https://t.co/SpMEvv1BzB Congratulations, Tiger! To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit, and determination. Another good story worth sharing: From one \"kid from Akron\" to a new generation of Akron kids, some remarkable early achievements at @IPROMISESchool. Great work, @KingJames\u2014and even better work by those students. Proud to be a witness to their success: https://t.co/ctWfKnA5GL From a big NBA fan, congrats to future Hall of Famers Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki\u2014not just all-time greats but class acts, too.

They just broke ground on a free grocery store to help families in need: https://t.co/o6pcAApZsm Great to see Chicago\u2019s historic mayoral race between two highly qualified candidates. Congrats to our next mayor, Lori Lightfoot\u2014and Toni Preckwinkle campaigned hard and did us proud. I know that with our city\u2019s heart and Lori\u2019s leadership, Chicago\u2019s best days are still ahead. Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors \u2013 she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know \u201cFinding My Voice\u201d will inspire others to lift their voices, too. https://t.co/nWTBDByMoz Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress\u2014it's a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who\u2019ve taken the torch.

And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/cRb4EKcrvv .@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she\u2019s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. https://t.co/jNIiKIAZaO .@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the https://t.co/3RwHe5Razz Foundation, she\u2019s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India\u2014and beyond. https://t.co/TKuAKVL5Y1 On International Women\u2019s Day, I\u2019m reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. And I\u2019m celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today. It\u2019s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair\u2014everywhere\u2014because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line.

It\u2019s true; she does get down to Motown. https://t.co/uypbZsEiqB In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country.

Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.

Happy New Year, everybody! I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn\u2019t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it. Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9 Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica.\u00a0https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I\u2019m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year. As 2018 draws to a close, I\u2019m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved.

To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment \u2013 and make sure they\u2019re paid equally. When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen. Tomorrow\u2019s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot. Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today.
