Mental health care shouldn't be a privilege for the wealthy. It should be accessible to all. Medicare for All will guarantee mental health coverage to every person in this country, free at the point of service. #WorldMentalHealthDay It's not coincidental that the top health care CEOs made $1.1 billion last year while 4 in 10 cancer patients lose their life savings due to treatment.\n\nOur system is designed to take money from sick people and put it in the pockets of rich executives.\n\nWe need Medicare for All.

We're going to address it with a wealth tax on the top 0.1%. A small handful of billionaires should not be able to accumulate more money than they could spend in 10 lifetimes while millions of Americans are living in poverty and dying because they can't afford health care. While working Americans ration insulin and work 2 or 3 jobs, the 1% saw its wealth increase by $21 trillion in the last 30 years.\n\nThe problem is not that Americans aren't working hard enough or saving enough money.\n\nThe problem is that the whole system is rigged against them. If we make the top 0.1% pay their fair share in taxes, their quality of life would not change at all. But we would be able to invest in housing, child care and health care and improve the lives of millions of working people. There is no justice when three billionaires are able to own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire country. There should be no billionaires.

As a federal judge who overwhelmingly sided with corporate power and Wall Street, Brett Kavanaugh should never have been nominated. At a time when their behavior is literally killing people, America needs a president who isn\u2019t going to appease and compliment drug companies. \n\nWe need a president who will take on the pharmaceutical industry \u2013 whether they like it or not.

Why do we have people working 40 hours a week and can\u2019t afford to feed their kids? The answer is pretty simple: wages in America are too damn low. Fracking is a danger to our water supply and the air we breathe. It causes earthquakes. It\u2019s highly explosive. To avert the climate crisis, we must ban fracking.

Unlike Donald Trump, I know what it's like to be in a family that lives paycheck to paycheck. We must envision a new form of American engagement: one in which we lead not in war-making but in finding shared solutions to shared global challenges. U.S. power should be measured not by our ability to blow things up, but to bring people together around our common humanity. This endless war has damaged America's global standing. It has scarred a generation. It has corroded our politics. It has cost American taxpayers nearly $6 trillion. And it has produced more terrorists. We must end this endless war. Instead of staying focused on those who attacked us, the Bush administration chose to declare a global \u201cwar on terror\u201d in order justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. The war on terror has turned into an endless war. In the nearly two decades since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States has made a series of costly blunders that have not only weakened our democracy but also undermined our leadership. Today, we remember the thousands of lives lost on September 11, 2001, and the bravery of first responders who put their lives at risk to save others.\n\nThe attacks began an era of endless war for our country and we must change course. https://t.co/UcKuln00lg Netanyahu's proposal to annex occupied territory would violate international law and make a two state solution nearly impossible.
