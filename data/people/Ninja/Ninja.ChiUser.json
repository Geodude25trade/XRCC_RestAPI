I\u2019m trying to use what I\u2019ve learned over 8 years of streaming and 10 years of professional gaming to stop shit I\u2019ve seen and done in the past. Learn from your mistakes! Also good on you creeping this hard @issa @parpyfn @TTfue When you bring up something irrelevant to the argument you take an L brother. Have a good one man ^_^ @issa @parpyfn @TTfue Two of those are jokes, and the other constructive criticism.  Not blatant negativity. Issa cmon man lol your stretching and it\u2019s embarrassing @infamous_FN @TTfue Someone forcing you to play? @parpyfn @TTfue Coming from the dude tweeting about how shit the game is yet plays it and uploads Fortnite videos everyday? What\u2019s more of an #ad? Shitty insult @TTfue I actually have been enjoying the game recently after the Gotham City update.

Everyone has a ball, shadows, or is flying around with the new rotation so shots are impossible. And if you try to take over someone's wall or rush with it... you either have a Tommy or a shotgun that doesn't one hit. Honestly.... I just played some of the worst Fortnite of my life. Felt completely out of my element and w/o the pump I froze in about 5 fights late game when my combat shotgun would not shoot out of shadow mode.
